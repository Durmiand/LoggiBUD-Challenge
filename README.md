# LoggiBUD-Challenge

The Virtual University of the State of Sao Paulo (Univesp) and Loggi, a logistics solutions company, created this challenge so that we had the opportunity to program in practice.

From a real problem, the knowledge developed in the Computer Science course will be applied in the search for innovative solutions.

The themes are divided into the following classes:

Lesson 1: Introduction to Colab and the LoggiBUD Repository.

Lesson 2: Introduction to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Lesson 3: Introduction to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).

Lesson 4: Static VRP in LoggiBUD.

Lesson 5: Dynamic VRP in LoggiBUD - Part 1.

Lesson 6: Dynamic VRP in LoggiBUD - Part 2.


In each class, a problem related to the subject was solved and submitted.
